With patience and kindness, you've shown me the way, In this world of coding, you're the sun's brightest ray. You've taught me the algorithms, the logic, the code, With you as my mentor, I'm on the right road. Your lectures are like music, so clear and so bright, In the world of computer science, you are the guiding light";

Pete's eyes, oh Pete's eyes, so bright and keen, In every adventure, he's the best I've seen. He runs, oh he runs, so swift and free, In the meadow, under the sun's decree. Pete's bark, oh Pete's bark, a cheerful sound, Echoing joy, all around. He jumps, oh he jumps, with boundless glee, Over hills and dales, so wild and carefree. Pete's paws, oh Pete's paws, leave prints so fine, In the sands of time, a treasure, a sign. With Pete, oh dear Pete, life's pure delight, A loyal friend, from morning to night. He's the one, oh the one, that warms my heart, In this tale of love, he's the central part. So here's to Pete, oh lovable Pete, With boundless love, our hearts shall beat. In this poem of praise, he takes the lead, Our cherished companion, indeed.";

    /*
     * Project Goal
     * You are writing a program to compute statistics about the word use in poems.
     * The program should take a poem (as a single String) and output (to the
     * console)
     * statistics about the word use. Example output is provided below (for POEM_C).
     * 
     * a (3)
     * is (3)
     * poem (3)
     * simple (3)
     * this (2)
     * done (1)
     * so (1)
     * 
     * Notes about the output...
     * - Words with the highest use are printed first.
     * - Words with the same use are sorted alphabetically.
     * 
     * Requirements...
     * - You must design and build your application to use at least 2 custom
     * classes.
     * - You must use an ArrayList as an integral part of your implementation.
     * - Your code should be well organized and a have good separation of concerns.
     * - Code quality is an important part of this assignment.
     * - Design your classes on paper before moving to coding.
